# How to report a security issue with dqlite

If you find a security issue with dqlite, the best way to report it is using
GitHub's private vulnerability reporting. [Here][advisory] is the form to
submit a report, and [here][docs] is the detailed documentation for the GitHub
feature.

Once you submit a report, the dqlite team will work with you to figure out
whether there is a security issue. If so, we will develop a fix, get a CVE
assigned, and coordinating the release of the fix. The [Ubuntu Security
disclosure and embargo policy][policy] contains more information about what you
can expect during this phase, and what we expect from you.
